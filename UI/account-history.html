                Dear Diary,
    I heard something from my youngest today
     that made me so sad...
    "The Sandlot" a film from 1993.
     Such a great movie.  
     My oldest was born in 1991 and 
     he grew up watching this film along with panda,
      my middle child, who was born in 96. 
      It was watched countless times in our home.
       So much so that "You're killing me Smalls"
        was a staple in our conversations. K tells me that 
        her dad said he has never seen this movie. Are you
         fucking kidding me?!?! Where was he? Fucking ass. 
         Like I warned him, "they grow up fast. 
         You don't want to miss it." Looks like he did.... sigh.  <br>

            I've been really productive today, 
            a nice change of pace from my last two weeks
             of depression and lethargy. 
          I feel something good is about to happen, 
          and I can't help but feel positive. 
          Unfortunately, I know this is temporary,
           but I like this feeling...
        I ran into my crush again at the pool, 
        also unfortunately clarified she had a partner. Bummer.               
    I've been single for two years now, 
    and I really want to connect with someone again. 
    It's hard to connect as adults, why does it seem so farfetched?</b> <br>

                         I kind of feel blank and void of emotions. 
                         I'm not sure how to make myself feel something

                     that happens to me ridiculously unbelievable.
                       I only wish it were bullshit.  
                       I also wish it to stop.  Desperately,

               Dear Diary, 
               Okay, this is not a one day job - my home. 
                I'll be reorganizing this place for days to reclaim my 
                standards.  But it didn't turn to chaos in a day
                My deep depression is lifting.  
                I did miss ECT this morning.  But I will complete the 
                last 3 next week.  Also, it is affecting my memory 
                (short-term only) which wasn't stellar before.  
                That's also slowing me down.  I'm not too stressed though. 
                 All I can do is my best.
                It is so refreshing to feel alive again and to look
                 forward to what lies <br>

                        Dear Diary,
                        It’s been very negative pretty much everywhere I go. 
    My mother wakes up and pretty much follows me around the house, a)
     being creepy (ie. looking in my door watching me doing pretty much 
     anything a person would typically do), b) insisting that the 
     whatever she wants to get done is done, c) being an over bearing cunt. 
     My dad and I are having car issues, while the women
      in my family do not. I was raised to believe we had a family, 
      but has evolved into a jealous pack of misled ppl. As my dad
       and I try to survive in a van that can't be driven after 6,
        my mom has two cars (she refuses to let my dad and I drive),
    my sister has two cars (that she won't let anyone drive),
     you can see how things are fucked up.

                                Dear Diary,
                                
                                Not sure what's going on.
                                 I kind of feel blank and void of emotions. 
                                 I'm not sure how to make myself feel something
                                  anymore. 
                                  Here’s the kicker, my other sisters car broke down, and guessed who drove their
                                   car to allow my sister to use it. My mother (the same professed Christian who masterbated while staring at me, when I was younger, she did n’t know I saw or remembered that) 
                                   took the car across town, so my sister could use it. 
                                  While this is happening the editor of the magazine I wrote for,
                                   basically stole my site, and then took my site down, and then played it off like she was letting me go, because she did n’t know me. Truly she was butt
                                   hurt for too many reasons to name, along with just being deceitful.
                                  There’s more I could say, but I just don't have too much time to dedicate to bulls***. I just want you to see how f***** things are currently.

                            Dear Diary, today i was at my girlfriend's
                             house, we were kissing and her mother 
                             walked into the kitchen, we froze and my
                              girlfriend told me "you have to go" so i 
                              had to walk for like 15 minutes in the rain 
                              until i got home, when i got home i
                               texted her and none of the messages got 
                               delivered, which means that her morher took
                                away her phone.<br>
